    "SQL statements that modify the database, like UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE, need to change not only the rows of the table but also the underlying indexes. Therefore, the performance of those statements depends on the number of indexes that need to be updated. The larger the number of indexes, the longer it takes those statements to execute. On the flip side, indexing can dramatically speed up row retrieval since no underlying indexes need to be modified. This is important for statements performing full table scans, like SELECTS and JOINs.\n",

    "- Advantages of Relational Databases: Ensure data integrity through a defined schema and the ACID properties. Easy to get started with and use for small-scale applications.

Lends itself better to applications that need to be highly available.\n",

The table with the primary key is called the parent table, whereas the table with the foreign key is called the child table. Since foreign keys create a link between the two tables, having foreign keys ensures that these links are valid and prevents data from being inserted that would otherwise violate these conditions. Foreign keys can be created during CREATE commands, and it is possible to DROP or ALTER foreign keys. \n",

    "When designating foreign keys, it is important to think about the cardinality — the relationship between parent and child tables. Cardinality can take on four forms: one-to-one (one row in the parent table maps to one row in the child table), one-to-many (one row in the parent table maps to many rows in the child table), many-to-one (many rows in the parent table map to one row in the\n",
